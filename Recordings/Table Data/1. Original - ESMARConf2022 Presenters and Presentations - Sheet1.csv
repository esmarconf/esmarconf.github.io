To achieve high accuracy, models often require huge volumes of ‘gold-standard’ labelled training data, which can be expensive and time-consuming to produce. As a result, ‘transfer learning’, in which NLP models, pre-trained on large corpora, are downloaded and finetuned on a smaller number of hand-labelled texts, is an increasingly popular method for achieving high-performance text classification. The availability of state-of-the-art transformer models via the open source ‘hugging face’ library has also improved the accessibility of this approach. However, materials outlining how to make use of such resources in R are limited.  At ESMARCONF 2022, I will introduce and demonstrate how transfer learning can be carried out in R and seamlessly integrated with data collection from academic databases and internet sources.

Ecological niche has been described in various ways; from habitat to role and from biotope to hypervolume. Although it has many different definitions, it remains one of the most fundamental concepts in Ecology. Our aim is to implement the Research Weaving framework on a large body of literature, relevant to the ecological niche in order to illustrate how this concept evolved since its introduction in the early 20th century.  We analysed over 29,000 publications using systematic maps and bibliometric webs. Our synthesis consisted of 8 components: phylogeny, type/validity, temporal trends, spatial patterns, contents, terms, authors, citations. We used bibliometric analyses, quantitative analyses of publication metadata and text mining algorithms. This integrative presentation of the development of the ecological niche concept provides an overview of how dynamics changed over time. It also allows us to detect knowledge gaps, while presenting a systematic summary of existing knowledge. To our knowledge, this is one of the first projects that implements the research weaving framework using exclusively automated processes.

Along with bibliographic databases, systematic reviewers use a variety of additional methods to minimise procedural bias, including assessing records that are cited by and that cite a set of articles of known relevance (citation chasing). Citation chasing exploits connections between research articles to identify relevant records for consideration in a review by making use of explicit mentions of one article within another. Citation chasing is a popular supplementary search method because it helps to build on the work of primary research and review authors. It does so by identifying potentially relevant studies that might otherwise not be retrieved by other search methods; for example, because they did not use the review authors’ search terms in the specified combinations in their titles, abstracts or keywords. Here, we describe an open source tool that allows for rapid forward and backward citation chasing. We introduce citationchaser, an R package and Shiny app for conducting forward and backward citation chasing from a starting set of articles.

In our general process to search > screen > extract > analyze, we found we need an intervening step: cleaning extracted data before analysis. The problem arises from a feature of our workflow: one person extracts the data, while another analyzes. Clean-up falls through the gap as we hand off data. Analysts must then spend time cleaning, though the extractor is far more familiar with the dataset. To work faster with fewer errors, we developed a stepwise cleaning checklist, then wrote code modules to fix common problems. But juggling Excel and R and a checklist still takes time and attention. To streamline further, we are developing a systematic solution: an interactive R-markdown notebook to take in parameters of the specific extraction dataset; clean and validate the data; and return a new cleaned dataset. We are testing with a recent systematic review dataset of ~2800 observations from >150 sources. This semi-automated interactive code has other benefits besides valid, upload-ready analysis data. First, a flexible, parameterized template enables faster work, easily repeated. Also, the code can reproducibly make documentation of cleaning done, or extraction history, or other reports on data, parameters, and results.

The second step combines the overall judgements about the risk of bias in pairwise comparisons with the percentage contribution of direct comparisons on the network meta-analysis (NMA) estimates, the likelihood of small-study effects, and any bias from unobserved comparisons. Then, a level of “low risk”, “some concerns” or “high risk” of bias due to missing evidence is assigned to each estimate. The ROB-MEN Shiny app runs the required analysis, semi-automates some of the steps and built-in algorithm to assign the overall risk of bias level for the NMA estimates and produces the tool’s output tables. We will present how the ROB-MEN app works using an illustrative example from a published NMA. ROB-MEN is the first tool for assessing the risk of bias due to missing evidence in NMA and is also incorporated in the reporting bias domain of the CINeMA software for evaluating the confidence in the NMA results.",Graphical user interface (including Shiny apps),Quality assessment / critical appraisal,Special Session 4: Quantitative synthesis - NMA,00:14:51,23/02/2022 10:15:00,23/02/2022 10:30:00,https://youtu.be/LccPtoFsdS4,"Chiocchia, Virginia (2022): The ROB-MEN Shiny app to evaluate risk of bias due to missing evidence in network meta-analysis.

This project aimed to develop novel graphics within MetaInsight (interactive NMA web-app: crsu.shinyapps.io/MetaInsight) to aid assessment of the ‘best’ intervention(s). The most granular results are from Bayesian rank probabilities and can be visualised with (cumulative) rank-o-grams. Summary measures exists, however, simpler measures (e.g. probability best) may be easier to interpret but are often more unstable and don’t encompass the whole analysis. Surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) is popular, directly linking with cumulative rank-o-grams. A critical assessment of current literature regarding ranking methodology and visualisation directed the creation of graphics in R using ‘ggplot’ and ‘shiny’. The Litmus Rank-O-Gram presents a cumulative rank-o-gram alongside a ‘litmus strip’ of SUCRA values acting as a key. The Radial SUCRA plot presents SUCRA values for each treatment radially with a network diagram of evidence overlaid. To aid interpretation and facilitate sensitivity analysis, the new graphics are interactive and presented alongside treatment effect and study quality results. Treatment ranking is powerful and should be interpreted cautiously with transparent, all-encompassing visualisations. This interactive tool will be pivotal for improving how researchers and stakeholders use and interpret ranking results.",Graphical user interface (including Shiny apps),Quantitative analysis / synthesis (including meta-analysis); Data visualisation,Special Session 4: Quantitative synthesis - NMA,00:13:43,23/02/2022 10:30:00,23/02/2022 10:45:00,https://youtu.be/cP0_cWOXhUo,"Nevill, Clareece (2022) Development of a Novel Multifaceted Graphical Visualisation for Treatment Ranking within an Interactive Network Meta-Analysis Web Application.

That evidence is obtained either from non-randomized studies (NRS) or randomized controlled trials and is accessible as individual participant data (IPD) or aggregate data (AD). We have developed a new R package, crossnma, which allows us to combine these different pieces of information while accounting for their differences. The package conducts a Bayesian NMA and meta-regression to synthesize cross-design evidence and cross-format data. It runs a range of models with JAGS by generating the code automatically from user’s input. A three-levels hierarchical model is implemented to combine IPD and AD and we also integrate four different models for combining the different study designs (a) ignoring their differences in risk of bias (b) using NRS to construct discounted treatment effect priors (c,d) adjusting for the risk of bias in each study in two different ways. Up to three study- or patient-level covariates can also be included, which may help explaining some of the heterogeneity and inconsistency across trials. TH and GS are supported by the HTx-project.

A very short primer on conducting multiverse meta-analyses in R,"Even though conventional meta-analyses provide an overview of the published literature, they do not consider different paths that could have been taken in selecting or analyzing the data. At times, multiple meta-analyses with overlapping research questions reach different conclusions due to differences in inclusion and exclusion criteria, or data analytical decisions. It is therefore crucial to evaluate the influence such choices might have on the result of each meta-analysis. Was the meta-analytical method and exclusion criteria decisive, or is the same result reached via multiple analytical strategies? What if a meta-analyst would have decided to go a different path—would the same outcome occur? Ensuring that the conclusions of a meta-analysis are not disproportionately influenced by data analytical decisions, a multiverse meta-analysis can provide the entire picture and underpin the robustness of the findings—or lack thereof—by conducting multiple, namely all possible and reasonable meta-analyses at once. Hereby, multiverse meta-analyses provide a research integration like umbrella reviews yet additionally investigate the influence flexibility in data analysis could have on the resulting summary effect size. During the talk I will give insight into this potent method, and run through the multiverse of meta-analyses on the efficacy of psychological treatments for depression as an empirical example.",Theoretical framework,Quantitative analysis / synthesis (including meta-analysis),Special Session 5: Other quantitative synthesis,00:14:15,23/02/2022 11:30:00,23/02/2022 11:45:00,https://youtu.be/qYUwIyRNOHU,"Yves Plessen, Constantin (2022) What if…?

In the framework of meta-analysis, such questions can be examined through moderator analyses. In practice, moderator analyses are complicated by the fact that meta-analytic data often include multiple dependent effect sizes per primary study. A common method to handle dependence, robust variance estimation (RVE), leads to excessive false positive results when the number of studies is small. Small-sample corrections for RVE have been proposed but they have low power, especially for multiple-contrast hypothesis tests (e.g., tests for whether average effects are equal across three different types of studies). Joshi, Pustejovsky & Beretvas (2021) examined an alternative method for handling dependence, cluster wild bootstrapping. The paper showed through simulation studies that cluster wild bootstrapping maintained adequate rates of false positive results while providing more power compared to existing small sample correction methods. In this presentation, I will introduce a package, called wildmeta, that implements cluster wild bootstrapping particularly for meta-analysis. The presentation will cover when and why meta-analysts should use cluster wild bootstrapping and, how to use the functions in the package with robumeta and metafor models.",Code package / library,Quantitative analysis / synthesis (including meta-analysis),Special Session 5: Other quantitative synthesis,00:11:23,23/02/2022 11:45:00,23/02/2022 12:00:00,https://youtu.be/WzT301yAtdE,"Joshi, Megha (2022) wildmeta: Cluster Wild Bootstrapping for Meta-Analysis.

Our models are parameterised by vital rates measuring survival and reproduction, which we collated through lit review and a call for data. We performed precision-weighted meta-analysis (Doncaster & Spake, 2018) for vital rates with >20 independent estimates: adult annual survival, clutch size (number of eggs laid) and hatching success (proportion of eggs producing hatchlings). We excluded estimates without associated sample size, and included variance estimates where provided/calculable, otherwise inputting the imputed mean variance. Random-effects error structure allowed for likely variation in population means across this species’ wide range; however, all I2 values were <1%, suggesting that most between-study variation was due to chance rather than true heterogeneity. In many cases, studies presented multiple estimates for a given vital rate – e.g. over different study areas and/or multiple years. Where appropriate, we conducted sub-meta-analyses to generate single estimates which could be handled equivalently to non-disaggregated estimates from other studies. These decisions align with the suggestions of Mengersen et al. (2013) and Haddaway et al.

Unfortunately, metabolomics studies rarely disclose all the statistical information needed to perform a meta-analysis in a traditional manner. Public meta-analysis tools can only by applied to data with standard deviation or directly to raw data. Currently there is no available methodology to do a meta-analysis based on studies that only disclose overall results. Here we present Amanida as a meta-analysis approach using only the most reported statistical parameters in this field: p-value and fold-change. The p-values are combined via Fisher’s method and fold-changes are combined by averaging, both weighted by the study size (n). The amanida package includes several visualization options: a volcano plot for quantitative results, a vote plot for total regulation behaviors (up/down regulations) for each compound, and a explore plot of the vote-counting results with the number of times a compound is found upregulated or downregulated. In this way, it is very easy to detect discrepancies between studies at a first glance.

It can lead to overestimation of effect sizes and overstating the evidence against the null hypothesis. In order to mitigate the impact of publication bias, multiple methods of adjusting for publication bias were developed. However, their performance varies based on the true data generating process, and different methods often lead to conflicting conclusions. We developed a robust Bayesian meta-analysis (RoBMA) framework that uses model-averaging to combine different meta-analytic models based on their relative predictive. In other words, it allows researchers to base the inference proportionally to the degree of how well the different models predicted the data. We implemented the framework in the RoBMA R package.

Teaching sessions for non-technical students involving R are often beset with technical problems such as outdated software versions, missing and conflicting dependencies, and a tendency for students to arrive on the session day without having installed required software. This causes the first hour(s) of practical sessions to turn into technical troubleshooting sessions. To circumvent these problems, we have created a self-contained web app using the ‘shiny’ and ‘LearnR’ R packages to demonstrate the capabilities of R in meta-analysis. This app runs on a web browser, without the need for students to run R or install packages on their own devices, thus allowing instructors to focus on teaching rather than technical troubleshooting. Using a dataset and code from a previously published systematic review and meta-analysis of animal studies, students are walked-through steps demonstrating theoretical and mathematical foundations of meta-analysis and ultimately replicate the analysis and results. This app supports our live educational workshops but is also designed to be a stand-alone learning resource. At each step, there are multiple choice questions for students to check their understanding of the material.

We will then delve into methods for combining the observed outcomes (i.e., via equal- and random-effects models) and for examining whether the outcomes depend on the characteristics of the studies from which they were derived (i.e., via meta-regression and subgrouping). A major problem that may distort the results of a meta-analysis is publication bias (i.e., when the studies included in a meta-analysis are not representative of all the relevant research that has been conducted on a particular topic). Therefore, current methods for detecting and dealing with publication bias will be discussed next. Finally, time permitting, we will look at some advanced methods for meta-analysis to handle more complex data structures that frequently arise in practice, namely when studies contribute multiple effect sizes to the same analysis, leading to dependencies in the data that need to be accounted for (via multilevel/multivariate models and robust variance estimation).",Summary / overview; Theoretical framework / proposed process or concept; Method validation study / practical case study,Education / capacity building; Quantitative analysis / synthesis (including meta-analysis); Data visualisation,,,,,https://www.wvbauer.com/doku.php/workshop_ma_esmarconf,,

Structural equation modelling can be used to conduct meta-analyses  in many ways that can extend the scope of meta-analyses. In this workshop, we will show step by step how to use structural equation modelling for conducting meta-analyses using R with metaSEM, lme4, and OpenMx packages. As an attendee, you will not need any previous experience of using these packages as we will show from start to finish with a set of preconfigured data, and you can later try with your own data sets. In the workshop, the instructor will conduct live coding and attendees will follow suit with questions and answers. All materials will be openly distributed in a github repository and be available before and after the workshop. We will use a hosted Rstudio instance, so please RSVP for this workshop so that accounts can be set up ahead of time.",Summary / overview; Theoretical framework / proposed process or concept; Method validation study / practical case study,Quantitative analysis / synthesis (including meta-analysis),,,,,https://youtu.be/z42HHrMRbV8,"Basu, Arindam (2022) ESMARConf2022 Workshop 5: Structural equation modelling.
